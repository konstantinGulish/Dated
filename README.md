# Dated
Dated!

Dates are fun to work with in Java 8!

 

Look at this example to see how easy working with dates can be:

Now, modify that exercise to make it show the following:

- The date entered in day, Month (3 letters) and year (4 digit) format

- The date entered in Month (3 letters), day  and year (4 digit) format

- The date entered in day, month (2 digits) and year format

Add output before each line to explain the format the user is looking at.

 

If the date the user enters is after today, the program should loop until the user enters a date on or before today.

 

If the date the user enters  is NOT in dd/mm/yyyy format, the user should be prompted to re-enter the date.
